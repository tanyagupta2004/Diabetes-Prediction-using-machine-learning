# Diabetes-Prediction-using-machine-learning
- The project used machine learning classifiers to compare and 
analyze accuracy of different machine learning classifier 
models. 
- The proposed method uses Logistic Regression, 
KNN, Naive Bayes, SVM, Decision Tree and Random 
Forest classifiers. 
- The result shows that the Random Forest 
achieved highest accuracy of 81.506.
- The proposed machine learning model is deployed into a webpage using streamlit in python

### _Web Intefrace Cretaed using Streamlit_
